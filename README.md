### Hi! I'm Katy.
I like to write code, make apps, and build robots. I'm also an alumna of *FIRST* Lego League and *FIRST* Tech Challenge robotics.

**Coding languages I know**
- I'm comfortable with Python, MIT App Inventor, and Java.
- I'm familiar with HTML and CSS. (I took a class a few years ago and if I had Google as a reference, I could probably figure it out.)

I'm **currently working on** a music-based app to help kids develop their fine motor skills.

Have a great day!
