### Hi! I'm Katy.
I like to write code, make apps, and build robots. I'm an alumna of *FIRST* Lego League and *FIRST* Tech Challenge robotics.

**Coding languages I know**
- I'm comfortable with Python, MIT App Inventor, and Java.
- I'm familiar with HTML and basic CSS. (I took a class on it a few years ago.)

I'm especially interested in working on projects that make a positive difference for people, which I've had the opportunity to do multiple  times in school. This year, I built a music-based app to help kids develop their fine motor skills. Before that, I created a game for my AP Computer Science Principles class about how to have helpful conversations about mental health with peers.

Have a great day!
